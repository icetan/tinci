More on [WebHooks and integration with\r\nGitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks).\r\n\r\n\r\nJust the hooks\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the GUI then you can just copy the hook script to your Git\r\nrepo manualy.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cp tinci/hooks/post-receive project.git/hooks/\r\n$ git config -f project.git/config --add tinci.runner \"make test\"\r\n```\r\n\r\ntinci will now run the shell command 'make test' each time someone pushes to\r\nyour repos master branch.\r\n\r\nTo run tinci on another branch or tag.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git config -f project.git/config --add tinci.match my-feature\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `tinci.match` setting uses regexp so you can specify tinci to run on all\r\npushes by giving the value `.*`.\r\n\r\ntinci will execute its own hooks on completion of a job. Place executable files\r\nin your repos `hooks` directory with the name `tinci`, `tinci-success` or\r\n`tinci-fail`.\r\n\r\nEach hook script will be called with the following arguments:\r\n\r\n1. last job exit code\r\n1. current exit code\r\n1. path to work directory\r\n\r\nThe `tinci` hook will be called on all completed jobs. `tinci-success` is only\r\ncalled on a job that exits with a zero and `tinci-fail` will only be called\r\nwhen a job exits with non-zero.\r\n\r\nThese hooks are compatible with `post-receive`, in other words each script will\r\nbe called with the same `stdin` value as the `post-receive` was.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample [fail hook for sending e-mail](https://raw.github.com/icetan/tinci/master/hooks/tinci-fail.sample) and a [success hook which syncs files to Amazon S3](https://raw.github.com/icetan/tinci/master/hooks/tinci-success.sample).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
